# == Definition: tomcat::instance
#
# This definition will create:
# - a CATALINA_BASE directory in /srv/tomcat/$name/, readable to tomcat,
#   writeable to members of the admin group.
# - /srv/tomcat/$name/conf/{server,web}.xml which can be modified by members of
#   the admin group.
# - a /srv/tomcat/$name/webapps/ directory where administrators can drop "*.war"
#   files.
# - an init script /etc/init.d/tomcat-$name.
# - /srv/tomcat/$name/bin/setenv.sh, which is loaded by the init script.
# - /srv/tomcat/$name/bin/setenv-local.sh, which is loaded by the setenv.sh, and
#   can be edited by members of the admin group.
# - rotation of /srv/tomcat/$name/logs/catalina.out.
#
# Parameters:
#
# - *name*: the name of the instance.
# - *ensure*: defines if the state of the instance. Possible values:
#   - present: tomcat instance will be running and enabled on boot. This is the
#     default.
#   - running: an alias to "ensure => present".
#   - stopped: tomcat instance will be forced to stop, and disabled from boot,
#     but the files won't be erased from the system.
#   - installed: tomcat instance will be disabled from boot, and puppet won't
#     care if it's running or not. Useful if tomcat is managed by heartbeat.
#   - absent: tomcat instance will be stopped, disabled and completely removed
#     from the system. Warning: /srv/tomcat/$name/ will be completely erased !
# - *owner": the owner of $CATALINA_BASE/{conf,webapps}. Defaults to "tomcat".
#   Note that permissions will be different, as tomcat needs to read these
#   directories in any case.
# - *group*: the group which will be allowed to edit the instance's
#   configuration files and deploy webapps. Defaults to "adm".
# - *umask*: controls the file mode creation mask, defaults to 0002
# - *server_port*: tomcat's server port, defaults to 8005.
# - *http_port*: tomcat's HTTP server port, defaults to 8080.
# - *http_address*: define the IP address tomcat's HTTP server must listen on.
#   Defaults to all addresses.
# - *ajp_port*: tomcat's AJP port, defaults to 8009.
# - *ajp_address*: define the IP address tomcat's AJP server must listen on.
#   Defaults to all addresses.
# - *conf_mode*: can be used to change the permissions on
#   /srv/tomcat/$name/conf/, because some webapps require the ability to write
#   their own config files. Defaults to 2570 (writeable only by $group members).
# - *logs_mode*: can be used to change the permissions on
#   /srv/tomcat/$name/logs/, because you may need to make the logs readable
#   by other users / everyone. Defaults to 2770.
# - *server_xml_file*: can be used to set a specific server.xml file
# - *web_xml_file*: can be used to set a specific web.xml file
# - *webapp_mode*: can be used to change the permissions on
#   /srv/tomcat/$name/webapps/. Defaults to 2770 (readable and writeable by
#   $group members and tomcat himself, for auto-deploy).
# - *java_home*: can be used to define an alternate $JAVA_HOME, if you want the
#   instance to use another JVM.
# - *sample*: set to "true" and a basic "hello world" webapp will be deployed on
#   the instance. You can test it by loading this URL:
#   http://localhost:8080/sample (where 8080 is the port defined by the
#   "http_port" parameter).
# - *setenv*: optional array of environment variable definitions, which will be
#   added to setenv.sh. It will still be possible to override these variables by
#   editing setenv-local.sh.
# - *connector*: an array of tomcat::connector name (string) to include in
#   server.xml
# - *executor*: an array of tomcat::executor name (string) to include in
#   server.xml
# - *catalina_logrotate*: install an UNMANAGED logrotate configuration file,
#   to handle the catalina.out file of the instance. Default to true.
# - *systemd_nofile*: number of open files limit configuration in systemd unit.
#   This has no effect on systems where tomcat is not managed by systemd.
# - *apr_listener*: If true, turn on the AprLifecycleListener in server.xml.  Default
#   is true for Tomcat > 6, false for all older versions of Tomcat.
#
# Requires:
# - one of the tomcat classes which installs tomcat binaries.
# - java to be previously installed.
# - logrotate to be installed.
#
# Example usage:
#
#   include tomcat
#   include tomcat::administration
#
#   tomcat::instance { "foo":
#     ensure => present,
#     group  => "tomcat-admin",
#   }
#
#   tomcat::instance { "bar":
#     ensure      => present,
#     server_port => 8006,
#     http_port   => 8081,
#     ajp_port    => 8010,
#     sample      => true,
#     setenv      => [
#       'JAVA_XMX="1200m"',
#       'ADD_JAVA_OPTS="-Xms128m"'
#     ],
#   }
