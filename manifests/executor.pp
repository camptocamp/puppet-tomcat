Parameters:
- *name*: the filename prefix

- *instance*: the name of the instance
- *owner*: the owner of this file (useful if manage=false)
- *thread_priority*: (int) the thread priority for threads in the executor
- *daemon*: whether the threads should be daemon threads or not
- *name_prefix*: the prefix for each thread created by the executor
- *max_threads*: (int) max number of active threads in this pool
- *min_spare_threads*: (int) minimum number of threads always kept alive
- *max_idle_time*: (int) number of milliseconds before an idle thread shutsdown
- *manage*: only add this file/executor if it isnâ€™t already present

Requires:
- one of the tomcat classes which installs tomcat binaries.
- a resource tomcat::instance.

Example usage:

  tomcat::executor {"default":
    ensure            => present,
    instance          => "tomcat1",
    max_threads       => 150,
    min_spare_threads => 25,
  }

  tomcat::connector {"http-8080":
    ensure   => present,
    instance => "tomcat1",
    owner    => "root",
    group    => "tomcat-admin",
    protocol => "HTTP/1.1",
    port     => 8080,
    executor => "default",
    manage   => true,
  }

  tomcat::instance { "tomcat1":
    ensure    => present,
    group     => "tomcat-admin",
    manage    => true,
    executor  => ["default"],
    connector => ["http-8080"]
  }
