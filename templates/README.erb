Hello, here is $CATALINA_BASE !

Having $CATALINA_BASE separated from $CATALINA_HOME allows you to override all
of tomcat's default options and behaviour without needing a privileged account.

More details can be found in this document:
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/RUNNING.txt

A few things you should keep in mind:

 - as you might expect, webapps must be placed in:
     /srv/tomcat/<%= @name %>/webapps/

 - you should be able to restart tomcat by running:
     "sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat-<%= @name %> (stop|start|restart)"

 - you can add/modify tomcat's environment variables by editing:
     /srv/tomcat/<%= @name %>/bin/setenv-local.sh
   This file is a shell script which will be evaluated inside the initscript:
     /etc/init.d/tomcat-<%= @name %>

 - you can edit /srv/tomcat/<%= @name %>/conf/{server,web}.xml and add files
   such as catalina.properties in /srv/tomcat/<%= @name %>/conf/

 - by default no logs go to /srv/tomcat/<%= @name %>/logs/catalina.out, they are
   redirected to log4j and end up in /var/log/tomcat/

 - you can change this behaviour by creating your own log4j.properties and
   setting the "common.loader" path to point to it, by editing
   catalina.properties.
   But please avoid leaving ever-growing logfiles on production systems !
