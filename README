= Tomcat Puppet module

This module is provided to you by Camptocamp[http://camptocamp.com/].

This module will install tomcat, either from a compressed archive or using
your system's package manager. This is done by including one of these classes:
- tomcat::package::v5-5
- tomcat::package::v6
- tomcat::v5-5
- tomcat::v6

=== Instances:

You'll then be able to define one or more tomcat instances, where you can drop
your webapps in the ".war" format. This is done with the "tomcat::instance"
definition.

The idea is to have several independent tomcats running on the same host, each
of which can be restarted and managed independently. If one of them happens to
crash, it won't affect the other instances. The drawback is that each tomcat
instance starts it's own JVM, which consumes memory.

This is implemented by having a shared $CATALINA_HOME, and each instance having
it's own $CATALINA_BASE. More details are found in this document:
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/RUNNING.txt

=== Logging:

To offer more flexibility and avoid having to restart tomcat each time
catalina.out is rotated, tomcat is configured to send it's log messages to
log4j. By default log4j is configured to send all log messages from all
instances to /var/log/tomcat/tomcat.log.

This can easily be overridden on an instance base by creating a custom
log4j.properties file and setting the "common.loader" path to point to it, by
editing /srv/tomcat/<name>/conf/catalina.properties.

=== Dependencies:

The Apache puppet module available at
http://github.com/camptocamp/puppet-apache is required if you want to make
use of Apache integration.

The Common puppet module available at
http://github.com/camptocamp/puppet-common is required if you want to install
tomcat from a compressed archive (it uses common::archive).


=== Defaults:

By default a new tomcat instance create by a tomcat::instance resource will
listen on the following ports:

* 8080 HTTP
* 8005 Control
* 8009 AJP

You should override these defaults by setting attributes server_port,
http_port and ajp_port.


=== Limitations:
- there is no way to automatically manage webapps (*.war files).
- the initscript calls catalina.sh instead of using jsvc. This prevents tomcat
  from listening on ports < 1024.

== Examples:

=== Simple standalone instance

Create a standalone tomcat instance whose HTTP server listen on port 8080:

  include tomcat::v6

  tomcat::instance {"myapp":
    ensure    => present,
    http_port => "8080",
  }

=== Apache integration:

Pre-requisites:

  include apache

  apache::module {"proxy_ajp":
    ensure  => present,
  }

  apache::vhost {"www.mycompany.com":
    ensure => present,
  }

Create a tomcat instance which is accessible via Apache using AJP on a given
virtualhost:

  include tomcat::v5-5

  tomcat::instance {"myapp":
    ensure      => present,
    ajp_port    => "8000",
    http_port   => "",
  }

  apache::proxypass {"myapp":
    ensure   => present,
    location => "/myapp",
    vhost    => "www.mycompany.com",
    url      => "ajp://localhost:8000",
  }


=== Multiple instances

If you create multiple Tomcat instances, you must avoid port clash by setting
distinct ports for each instance::

  include tomcat::package::v5-5

  tomcat::instance {"tomcat1":
    ensure      => present,
    server_port => "8005",
    http_port   => "8080",
    ajp_port    => "8009",
  }

  tomcat::instance {"tomcat2":
    ensure      => present,
    server_port => "8006",
    http_port   => "8081",
    ajp_port    => "8010",
  }
